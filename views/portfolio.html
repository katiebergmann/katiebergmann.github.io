								<h3>The Odyssey book cover and poster<span><i>Poster: 20” x 40” Mixed Media: Paper, Foam, Photoshop & Illustrator (2015)</i></h3>
								<p>The Odyssey has been a book that has always created a lot of vivid, visual interest for me growing up and when I was given the chance to re-illustrate novels for my Senior Exhibition project, I jumped at the opportunity to recreate scenes from Homer’s most classic novel. My vision was to depict a minimalist and originial interpretation of Scylla, a Greek mythlogical sea monster who lived on one side of a narrow channel opposite of Charbydis. Originally constructing the outline from points and paths in Illustrator, I cut each scale out of a deep-blue metallic paper and hand-laid each piece usings foam pop dots and adhesive to create a three dimensional appearance. The overall image was broken into 5 segments before I photographed them and ran them through both Photoshop and Illustrator to create my final image. While I exhibited the design as a large movie-sized poster, it can also be applied to a book cover as well. My goal was to make this design one that can stand on its own as both a poster but also be visually interesting for a book cover as well.</p>

								<h3>Whitworth Senior Exhibition Poster<span><i>Poster: 11” x 17” Illustrator (2015)</i></h3>
								<p>This poster was created for Whitworth Universities Senior Exhibition: Dialogue. Each
								of the artists featured in the senior exhibitions main goal was to create something visually stimulating to
								the viewer, to convey a message, and evoke some sort of response or emotion from the viewer. Therefore
								the most basic concept behind “Dialogue” is that there is a conversation between two or more people. In
								this circumstance, the conversation is between the artists and the viewer of the exhibition. My goal was to
								somehow illustrate this concept without using the typical cliche imagery one might think of when hearing
								the word “dialogue” (ie: talking, people, words, etc.). For me, when I think of dialogue, I think of connections
								and how conversation brings people together so I chose to go abstract in design and create an abstract
								mesh made of lines and circles in order to illustrate “connections”. The background is a made-from-hand
								low poly art design that enhance the abstract mesh in both visual interest and in concept. The postcard is
								simply the negative version of the poster. The deep blue colors were chosen due to the sight location which
								consist of several red, brick walls around campus - in this way, the colors will make the poster stand out
								against the wall and other posters that surround it.</p>

								<h3>Japan Celebration Poster<span><i>11” x 17” Mixed Media: Origami Paper, Ink, Paint, Photoshop & Illustrator (2014)</i></h3>
								<p>This design was created as a celebration poster for San Fancisco, California’s 108th Anniversary - the
								oldest and one of the last remaining Japantowns in the United States of America. Before this project, I
								had primarly done all of my designs using only computer software and Adobe programs, so I wanted
								to incorporate several various mediums in order to make this poster highly unique. My inspiration was
								derived from both classical Japanese art as well as the landscape. In order to construct this image, I cut
								out the landscape by hand from traditional and authentic Japanese origami paper, crumpled each piece to
								add texture and then scanned it into the computer. Photoshop was used to manipulate each piece so that
								they would fit evenly together and to add dimension into the landscape image. Underneath the landscape
								is a simple silhouette image of the San Francisco skyline and it even features the famous five-tiered
								Peace Pagonda that is unique to SanFran’s Japantown. The Japanese symbol in the upper right hand
								corner represents the number 108 in relation to Japantown’s 108th anniversary and even doubles as a
								representation of the mountains in the landscape adjacent.</p>

								<h3>Tide Pod Bus Wrap<span><i>11” x 17” Illustrator (2014)</i></h3>
								<p>This illustration is a concept for an electric bus wrap design for the cleaning product - Tide Pods.
								Essentially the electric bus is a better, cleaner, and more innovative means of transportation in the similar
								way that Tide Pods is a “cleaner, greener” means of cleaning since it is a detergent, stain remover, and
								brightener all-in-one minus the harmful chemicals most detergents have. The theme of the bus is centered
								around one of the three scents: Ocean Mist. The tide pods stand in for possible fish that would typically be
								in an ocean scene and are involved with a clean, clear, and bright environment enhancing the idea that Tide
								Pods are a product that are clean, bright, and efficient just like the electric bus.</p>

								<h3>Customized Wine Label<span><i>2 “x 8 1/2” Mixed Media: Paper, Ink, Photoshop & Illustrator (2014)</i></h3>
								<p>This design is meant to be a wine label wrap for a mead (honey wine) bottle. I chose to create an entirely
								made up brand in order to test myself with how well I can do designing something from thin air as
								opposed to working with a prompt. For this project, I centered my concept around mead - a honey wine
								made from clovers and honey, therefore I named my brand White Clover. I wanted my design to be classy
								so I stuck to a simple palette of matte black, white, and a prominent gold color in order to make this brand
								feel more high-end. The winery, Abeja Vineyards, was derived from the Spanish word “abeja” meaning
								honeybee in order to connect back to the importance of bees in the making of mead. The dates and
								locations were taken from my own life in order to make the design a little bit more personal - after all, this
								is a hypothetical design! I initally made the design on Illustrator, using Photoshop for the image of the bee,
								and then printed it. With a gold pen, I went back in and traced over the design and scanned it back into
								Photoshop to fix some mistakes. By doing this, it gives the designs a more three-dimensional presence.
								The biggest challenge of this design was to incorporate a standard-sized bar code and Surgeon General’s
								warning in a way that did not take over the design or distract the viewer to much. By using the white in
								other places, I believe it helps to hide the ugliness and the size of that portion of the label.</p>

								<h3>Valentine's Day Card<span><i>5.5” x 8.5” Folded & Illustrator (2014)</i></h3>
								<p>My concept behind this Valentine’s Day Card was in pursuit of articulating what “love” is and translating
								the universal truths of it within the human experience. A large portion of this project was centered around
								avoiding cliche imagery such as hearts, the color red and cherubs, as well as the love-puns that appear
								quite commonly among Valentine’s Day cards. The concept I decided to represent as a universal is the idea
								that “love grows”. Illustrated quite simply by the tree and the leaves moving outwards, the tree represents
								time and the idea of continuous growth, both factors in the loving relationships we have with others. I
								believe that details are what can make a good design great and therefore are extremely important in all
								of my work, therefore, I transferred the idea of the tree to the back of the card by integrating it into the bar
								code. Underneath the bar code, can be found the date for Valentine’s Day (a stand in for the code that would
								be there if actually created by a company). Even though I wanted to avoid all the V-day cliches, I still wanted
								to add a little something fun to this design to push the concept even further. So in the very center of the
								tree, there is a small heart worked into the shape of the tree rings - a little “Easter egg” for the viewer.</p>

								<h3>Fluevog Soprano Carey Advertisment<span><i>11” x 17” Mixed Media: Photography, Photoshop & Illustrator (2014)</i></h3>
								<p>John Fluevog is known for his lines of progressive, unique, and art deco style of shoes and the Soprano
								Carey is no different. This design was constructed for a design brief surrounding the Soprano Carey. Since
								Fluevog prides itself on the uniqueness and attention-grabbing nature of this shoe, my advertisment
								design features the most unique and flamboyant of all animals, the peacock, who is seemingly hoarding
								multiple pairs of the Soprano Careys in its nest. Since the image of the peacock was constructed to be an
								illustration, I had to make the shoes fit into the illustrated environment. Using Illustrator and Photoshop, I
								designed a graphic image of the shoe derived from the original photo. This helped to incorporate the shoe
								to the environment and enhanced the idea that the Soprano Carey’s are “unique soles for unique souls”.</p>

								<h3>Typography Logo Design<span><i>8.5” x 11” Illustrator (2014)</i></h3>
								<p>The point of this project is very simple - to utilize both typeface and design in order to create in interesting
								logo. In these two images, I designed two animals that could potentially be part of a logo - a chameleon and
								a squirrel. I created these images using the typeface Curlz MT and every aspect of the animal is taken from
								part of the inital letter. For the chameleon, the eye and toes were taken from the baseline of the “C” while
								the chin of the lizard is from the beak. As for the squirrel, the ear and eye were taken from the end point of
								the tip of the “S” and the face, foot, and paw were taken from the baseline of the “S”.</p>

								<h3>Celebrate Hispanic Culture Stamp<span><i>7/8” x 1” and 8.5” x 11” Landscape: Photoshop & Illustrator (2014)</i></h3>
								<p>Stamps help to illuminate what is valued in people and in their culture. In this case, hispanic culture is
								what is represented within this particular stamp. For this project, I tried to combine both American (since
								it is a US Forever stamp) and Hispanic culture in a way that would convey a balance. I did this by tracing
								Hispanic roots back to the Aztec and Mayan cultures - the ancient civilizations of the Hispanics, and drew
								from their art as inspiration for this stamp. By using imagery from American culture, the flag, and the traditional
								patterns of Hispanic art, I created an illustration of both cultures without one overpowering the other.
								The biggest challenge in this project was simply constructing an image that, when shrunken to the size of
								a stamp, would not lose its details and meaning.</p>
